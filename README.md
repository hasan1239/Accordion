# Accordion
Version 1.1 12/09/2017

Propeller Front-End Build Test 

# General notes
- I was able to make the accordion responsive, changing the window size adjusts the layout accordingly. However, when adding the border line for the text, it does not seem to behave the same way as the other element0.s
- I used the color picker tool in paint to find the relevant RGB values for each of the colours given in the image.
- I was unable to find the right arrow unicode that you used so I had to use the closest one I could. If you could send me the unicode for that one, that would be much appreciated. 
- I am only familiar with JSON so having to dynamically populate the accordion was new to me. I finally learned how to do it which was quite fun!

# Separate files
I thought that using separate files would be a much better route to take. Adding all of HTML, JS script and CSS script into one file would be annoying if someone new was to look over the code and understand it.

# W3C Markup Validation Service 
I ran the HTML code through the service and found no errors or warnings.
